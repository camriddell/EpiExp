  abstract =      {(1) One of the most striking features in the study of
                   epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal
                   factor which appears to be adequate to account for
                   the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease
                   which visit almost every population. It was with a
                   view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects
                   of the various factors which govern the spread of
                   contagious epidemics that the present investigation
                   was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the
                   work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same
                   problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a
                   further stage, and it is considered from a point of
                   view which is in one sense more general. The problem
                   may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected
                   person is introduced into a community of individuals,
                   more or less susceptible to the disease in question.
                   The disease spreads from the affected to the
                   unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person
                   runs through the course of his sickness, and finally
                   is removed from the number of those who are sick, by
                   recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or
                   death vary from day to day during the course of his
                   illness. The chances that the affected may convey
                   infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent
                   upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic
                   spreads, the number of unaffected members of the
                   community becomes reduced. Since the course of an
                   epidemic is short compared with the life of an
                   individual, the population may be considered as
                   remaining constant, except in as far as it is
                   modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease
                   itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come
                   to an end. One of the most important probems in
                   epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination
                   occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left,
                   or whether the interplay of the various factors of
                   infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in
                   termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are
                   still present in the unaffected population. It is
                   difficult to treat this problem in its most general
                   aspect. In the present communication discussion will
                   be limited to the case in which all members of the
                   community are initially equally susceptible to the
                   disease, and it will be further assumed that complete
                   immunity is conferred by a single infection.},

                   requires knowledge of an extensive array of parameter
                   values for the economy at large. This essay describes
                   the parameters required for different economic

                   the overlapping generations model enriched to

  abstract =      {The goal of this chapter is to study how, and by how
                   much, household income, wealth, and preference
                   heterogeneity amplify and propagate a macroeconomic
                   shock. We focus on the U.S. Great Recession of
                   2007-2009 and proceed in two steps. First, using data
                   from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we document
                   the patterns of household income, consumption and
                   wealth inequality before and during the Great
                   Recession. We then investigate how households in
                   different segments of the wealth distribution were
                   affected by income declines, and how they changed
                   their expenditures differentially during the
                   aggregate downturn. Motivated by this evidence, we
                   study several variants of a standard heterogeneous
                   household model with aggregate shocks and an
                   endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our
                   key finding is that wealth inequality can
                   significantly amplify the impact of an aggregate
                   shock, and it does so if the distribution features a
                   sufficiently large fraction of households with very
                   little net worth that sharply increase their saving
                   (i.e. they are not hand-to mouth) as the recession
                   hits. We document that both these features are
                   observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role
                   that social insurance policies, such as unemployment
                   insurance, play in shaping the cross-sectional income
                   and wealth distribution, and through it, the dynamics
                   of business cycles.},

                   that people choose, the jobs they obtain, the
                   products they buy, and how they vote. The many
                   aspects of our lives that are governed by social
                   networks make it critical to understand how they
                   impact behavior, which network structures are likely
                   to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves
                   as we do. In Social and Economic Networks, Matthew
                   Jackson offers a comprehensive introduction to social
                   and economic networks, drawing on the latest findings
                   in economics, sociology, computer science, physics,
                   and mathematics. He provides empirical background on
                   networks and the regularities that they exhibit, and
                   discusses random graph-based models and strategic
                   models of network formation. He helps readers to
                   understand behavior in networked societies, with a
                   detailed analysis of learning and diffusion in
                   networks, decision making by individuals who are
                   influenced by their social neighbors, game theory and
                   markets on networks, and a host of related subjects.
                   Jackson also describes the varied statistical and
                   modeling techniques used to analyze social networks.
                   Each chapter includes exercises to aid students in
                   their analysis of how networks function. This book is
                   an indispensable resource for students and

  year =          {1992},
  abstract =      {This book deals with infectious diseases -- viral,
                   bacterial, protozoan and helminth -- in terms of the
                   dynamics of their interaction with host populations.
                   The book combines mathematical models with extensive
                   use of epidemiological and other data. This analytic
                   framework is highly useful for the evaluation of
                   public health strategies aimed at controlling or
                   eradicating particular infections. Such a framework
                   is increasingly important in light of the widespread
                   concern for primary health care programs aimed at
                   such diseases as measles, malaria, river blindness,
                   sleeping sickness, and schistosomiasis, and the
                   advent of AIDS/HIV and other emerging viruses.
                   Throughout the book, the mathematics is used as a
                   tool for thinking clearly about fundamental and
                   applied problems having to do with infectious
                   diseases. The book is divided into two parts, one
                   dealing with microparasites (viruses, bacteria and
                   protozoans) and the other with macroparasites
                   (helminths and parasitic arthropods). Each part
                   begins with simple models, developed in a
                   biologically intuitive way, and then goes on to
                   develop more complicated and realistic models as
                   tools for public health planning. The book
                   synthesizes previous work in this rapidly growing
                   field (much of which is scattered between the
                   ecological and the medical literature) with a good
                   deal of new material.},

                   Others are not. It is generally difficult to find
                   observable fundamentals that are useful for
                   predicting whether a boom will turn into a bust or
                   not. We develop a model consistent with these
                   observations. Agents have heterogeneous expectations
                   about long-run fundamentals but change their views
                   because of “social dynamics.” Agents with tighter
                   priors are more likely to convert others to their
                   beliefs. Boom-bust episodes typically occur when
                   skeptical agents happen to be correct. The booms that
                   are not followed by busts typically occur when
                   optimistic agents happen to be correct.},

                   forecasts of inflation by selecting a predictor
                   function from a set of costly alternatives whereby
                   they may rationally choose a method other than the
                   most accurate. We use this model to test whether
                   survey data exhibit rationally heterogeneous
                   expectations. Maximum likelihood is applied to a new
                   discrete choice setting where the observed variable
                   is continuous and the latent variable is discrete.
                   The results show there is dynamic switching that

  abstract =      {Macroeconomic modelling has been under intense
                   scrutiny since the Great Financial Crisis, when
                   serious shortcomings were exposed in the methodology
                   used to understand the economy as a whole. Criticism
                   has been levelled at the assumptions employed in the
                   dominant models, particularly that economic agents
                   are homogenous and optimising and that the economy is
                   equilibrating. In a related paper (Haldane and
                   Turrell Oxford Rev Econ Polic 34(1–2):219–251
                   2018), we argue that an interdisciplinary approach to
                   modelling in macroeconomics is beneficial. Here we
                   focus on what one such approach - agent-based
                   modelling, which has been extensively used across a
                   wide range of disciplines - could do for
                   macroeconomics. Agent-based models are complementary
                   to existing approaches to macroeconomics and are
                   particularly well-suited to answering questions where
                   complexity, heterogeneity, networks, and heuristics
                   play an important role.},

                   disagreement is more tightly related to trading

  abstract =      {Social networks can shape many aspects of social and
                   economic activity: migration and trade, job-seeking,
                   innovation, consumer preferences and sentiment,
                   public health, social mobility, and more. In turn,
                   social networks themselves are associated with
                   geographic proximity, historical ties, political
                   boundaries, and other factors. Traditionally, the
                   unavailability of large-scale and representative data
                   on social connectedness between individuals or
                   geographic regions has posed a challenge for
                   empirical research on social networks. More recently,
                   a body of such research has begun to emerge using
                   data on social connectedness from online social
                   networking services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and
                   Twitter. To date, most of these research projects
                   have been built on anonymized administrative
                   microdata from Facebook, typically by working with
                   coauthor teams that include Facebook employees.
                   However, there is an inherent limit to the number of
                   researchers that will be able to work with social
                   network data through such collaborations. In this
                   paper, we therefore introduce a new measure of social
                   connectedness at the US county level. Our Social
                   Connectedness Index is based on friendship links on
                   Facebook, the global online social networking
                   service. Specifically, the Social Connectedness Index
                   corresponds to the relative frequency of Facebook
                   friendship links between every county-pair in the
                   United States, and between every US county and every
                   foreign country. Given Facebook's scale as well as
                   the relative representativeness of Facebook's user
                   body, these data provide the first comprehensive
                   measure of friendship networks at a national level.},

                   influenced by social interaction. In our model, any
                   given “social” investor finds the market more
                   attractive when more of his peers participate. We
                   test this theory using data from the Health and
                   Retirement Study, and find that social
                   households—those who interact with their neighbors,
                   or attend church—are substantially more likely to
                   invest in the market than non-social households,
                   controlling for wealth, race, education, and risk
                   tolerance. Moreover, con- sistent with a peer-effects
                   story, the impact of sociability is stronger in
                   states where stock-market participation rates are
                   higher.},

  abstract =      {This paper develops first measures of housing
                   sentiment for 34 cities across the U.S. by
                   quantifying the qualitative tone of local housing
                   news. I find that housing media sentiment has
                   significant predictive power for future house prices,
                   above and beyond his- torically predictive factors
                   and past returns. Sentiment leads price movements by
                   more than two years, and is highly correlated with
                   available survey expectations measures. The structure
                   of the media sentiment index itself reflects a
                   backward-looking nature consistent with extrapolative
                   expectations. Consistent with theories of sentiment,
                   the media sentiment index has a greater effect in
                   markets with more minority homebuyers, more
                   speculative investors, and across lower-priced homes.
                   Including additional controls for subprime lending
                   and easy credit has no impact on the magnitude of the
                   results, but the predictive effect of sentiment is
                   amplified in markets where more subprime loans were
                   issued. Directly investigating the content across
                   news articles finds that results are not driven by
                   news stories of unobserved fundamentals.},

                   Times bestselling author Robert Shiller, a new way to
                   think about how popular stories help drive economic
                   eventsIn a world in which internet troll farms
                   attempt to influence foreign elections, can we afford
                   to ignore the power of viral stories to affect
                   economies? In this groundbreaking book, Nobel
                   Prize–winning economist and New York Times
                   bestselling author Robert Shiller offers a new way to
                   think about the economy and economic change. Using a
                   rich array of historical examples and data, Shiller
                   argues that studying popular stories that affect
                   individual and collective economic behavior—what he
                   calls "narrative economics"—has the potential to
                   vastly improve our ability to predict, prepare for,
                   and lessen the damage of financial crises,
                   recessions, depressions, and other major economic
                   events.Spread through the public in the form of
                   popular stories, ideas can go viral and move
                   markets—whether it's the belief that tech stocks
                   can only go up, that housing prices never fall, or
                   that some firms are too big to fail. Whether true or
                   false, stories like these—transmitted by word of
                   mouth, by the news media, and increasingly by social
                   media—drive the economy by driving our decisions
                   about how and where to invest, how much to spend and
                   save, and more. But despite the obvious importance of
                   such stories, most economists have paid little
                   attention to them. Narrative Economics sets out to
                   change that by laying the foundation for a way of
                   understanding how stories help propel economic events
                   that have had led to war, mass unemployment, and
                   increased inequality.The stories people tell—about
                   economic confidence or panic, housing booms, the
                   American dream, or Bitcoin—affect economic
                   outcomes. Narrative Economics explains how we can
                   begin to take these stories seriously. It may be
                   Robert Shiller's most important book to date.},

                   to runs can attract deposits. Investors face
                   privately observed risks which lead to a demand for
                   liquidity. Traditional demand deposit contracts which
                   provide liquidity have multiple equilibria, one of
                   which is a bank run. Bank runs in the model cause
                   real economic damage, rather than simply reflecting
                   other problems. Contracts which can prevent runs are
                   studied, and the analysis shows that there are
                   circumstances when government provision of deposit
                   insurance can produce superior contracts.},
