class="t1xr-x-x-109">‘Epidemiological’ models of belief formation put social interactions at their core; such models are widely</span>
<span 
class="t1xr-x-x-109">used by scholars who are not economists to study the dynamics of beliefs in populations. We survey the</span>
<span 
class="t1xr-x-x-109">literature in which economists attempting to model the consequences of beliefs about the future –</span>
<span 
class="t1xr-x-x-109">‘expectations’ – have employed a full-ﬂedged epidemiological approach to explore an economic question. We</span>
<span 
class="t1xr-x-x-109">draw connections to related work on ‘contagion,’ narrative economics, news/rumor spreading, and the spread</span>
<span 
class="t1xr-x-x-109">of internet memes. A main theme of the paper is that a number of independent developments have recently</span>
<span 
class="t1xr-x-x-109">converged to make epidemiological expectations (‘EE’) modeling more feasible and appealing than in the past.</span>

<!--l. 215--><p class="indent" >  “Expectations” are just a category of ideas. So upon being told that expectations play a critical role
in structural economic modeling, a scholar who was not an economist might suppose that
epidemiological approaches would be a standard part of the economist’s toolkit for modeling
expectations — unless there were good reason to believe that economic ideas are immune to
social inﬂuence. But evidence for social transmission of economic ideas is plentiful – see
Section <a 
href="#x3-200004.4">4.4<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:microEvidence --></a>.
<!--l. 217--><p class="indent" >  Still, it would not be accurate to say that an ‘epidemiological expectations’ (‘EE’) approach is a
standard way of constructing formal models of economic phenomena – a conventional
oﬀ-the-shelf alternative, say, to a ‘rational expectations’ (‘RE’) approach, the ‘Rational
Inattention’ (‘RI’) approach advocated by <span

lesson of micro economics is that “people are diﬀerent in ways that importantly aﬀect their economic
behavior.”
Since then, a great deal of the progress in macro economics has come from incorporating
microeconomic heterogeneity “in ways that importantly aﬀect” macroeconomic behavior. (See
“Macroeconomics and Heterogeneity” in the latest <span 
class="t1xi-x-x-120">Handbook of Macroeconomics</span>, <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>). In particular,
Heterogeneous Agent (‘HA-Macro’) models that match the distributions of income and wealth have
now provided rigorous microfoundations for Keynesian macroeconomics by capturing measured
heterogeneity in (and a large average value for) the marginal propensity to consume – see <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>’s Laﬀont
lecture.
<!--l. 256--><p class="indent" >  But few models in the HA-Macro literature have allowed for diﬀerences in agents’ expectations
about variables like stock returns (where everyone’s realized outcome will be identical) – though
disagreements on such subjects are rife and people make choices that correspond to their expressed
beliefs (<span

<!--l. 259--><p class="indent" >  Partly, the failure to incorporate expectational heterogeneity reﬂects the fact that until recently
there was not widespread awareness among macroeconomists that measurable expectation
diﬀerences have power to explain observable microeconomic behavior. Evidence of the recent change
in attitudes can be seen in the published discussions in the 2017 <span 
class="t1xi-x-x-120">NBER Macroeconomics Annual</span>
of <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>’s paper surveying the literature on the measurement of expectations (in which Manski himself
has been the leading ﬁgure, and until recently something of a lone voice crying in the
wilderness). The commissioning of this <span 
class="t1xi-x-x-120">Handbook</span>, and the proliferation of new research
summarized herein, are among the many other indications of a sea-change in the profession’s
attitudes.
<!--l. 279--><p class="indent" >  The proliferation of new data on expectations, and new evidence that they explain diﬀerences in
behavior, seem likely to tempt economists to produce models to ﬁt the facts. Our guess is
that epidemiological models may be one of the primary methods of accomplishing this
goal.

<!--l. 279--><p class="noindent" >Below we brieﬂy summarize the extensive literature outside of economics measuring the spread of
ideas. One element is missing from almost all of this work: a rigorous description of a mechanism
that accounts for an endogenous <span 
class="t1xi-x-x-120">origin </span>of the ideas.
<!--l. 279--><p class="indent" >  Economists and philosophers seem to be unusual in wanting a rigorous epistemology: An
account of the origin of the ideas and why they are ‘justiﬁed.’ The Rational Expectations
approach resolves this problem by making some rather bold assumptions (there is only one
‘true’ model of the world; everyone fully understands and completely believes the same
true model; everyone observes an identical set of facts and uses deductive reasoning to
draw the same conclusions from them; everyone <span 
class="t1xi-x-x-120">knows </span>that everyone deduces ... ; and so
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
on).
<!--l. 279--><p class="indent" >  An appealing way to connect these approaches is for epidemiological models in economics to be
built to be ‘tunable’ in the degree to which they diﬀer from more familiar models (like
‘rational expectations’). This should not be hard: If the only ‘source’ of ideas is an agent who
believes in the rational expectations solution, and the infection rate is 100 percent, the
solution will be the rational expectations solution. It will then be possible to pin down,
step by step, the reasons for any deviation between the EE and the corresponding RE
model.
<!--l. 279--><p class="indent" >  In fact, most of the examples of EE models we articulate below are of this kind: There is some
parameter or set of parameters which can be set to zero (or some other speciﬁc value), causing the
model to collapse to a RE model.

formulated the problem as one of tracking the size of ‘compartments’ of the population in diﬀerent
disease states (‘Susceptible’ to infection, ‘Infected,’ or ‘Recovered’; S, I, and R for short) under a
‘random mixing’ assumption in which all members of the population were equally likely to
encounter each other in a time interval. These assumptions allowed formulation of the problem as a
set of nonlinear diﬀerential equations.

model in which connections among agents were a ‘random graph’ (the network analog of
the ‘random mixing’ assumption), so the only parameter was ‘degree’: the number of
connections each agent had. Subsequent work relaxed the random graph assumption,
allowing meaningful deﬁnition of an agent’s ‘neighbors,’ and showed that a ‘clustering
coeﬃcient’ is a useful measurement of the extent to which a person’s neighbors know each

<!--l. 427--><p class="indent" >  The best-known epidemiological framework adds an ‘R’ state that can designate
either recovery or ‘removal’ (via, say, death), yielding the ‘classical’ SIR
models.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

The SIR framework has rich and interesting implications, such as the potential for ‘herd immunity’
which comes about when a high enough proportion of the population has either Recovered or
otherwise been Removed (say, by vaccination) from the Susceptible compartment.
<!--l. 432--><p class="indent" >  Options proliferate from there.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

A framework in which there are two possible outcomes of the infection, recovery or death, receives
the acronym SIRD. If the disease is one in which it is necessary to track the proportion who have
been Exposed but are not yet (and may never become) infected, the result is an SEIR model – and so
on.
<!--l. 438--><p class="indent" >  One standard assumption for all of these models is that agents are <span 
class="t1xi-x-x-120">ex-ante </span>homogeneous, but the
classical framework can be extended to permit various kinds of heterogeneity – at the considerable
cost of adding whole new systems of nonlinear diﬀerential equations. An advantage of the network
approach is that since it is solved by simulation, modiﬁcations of the model are much easier to
make because they do not add new systems of simultaneous diﬀerential equations to be
solved.

<!--l. 451--><p class="noindent" ><a 
 id="AdaptingTheModel"></a>
<!--l. 453--><p class="indent" >  Basic epidemiological models usually study the dynamics of a single disease in a population, with
a natural terminal stage like recovery or death. Economists will often be interested in keeping track of
how expectations change about an aggregate variable like stock prices, which does not have a
terminal point and in which many competing opinions may infect diﬀerent people at the same
time.
<!--l. 455--><p class="indent" >  An advantage of network-theory tools is that they can easily accommodate ways in which an
economic application may call for such modiﬁcations. It is trivial to represent as many competing
‘diseases’ (e.g., theories of stock prices) as desired, and there is no need to specify a ‘recovery’
state.
<!--l. 457--><p class="indent" >  To take a more complex example, in classical epidemiological models it would be painful to
capture dynamics of a disease in which people become ‘more infected’ after repeated contact with
other infected people. But in a network model, it is easy to capture the proposition that a person may

steady-state where most people have cycled through infection and recovery. Even in the case with the
smallest reproduction ratio, the proportion who cycle through the process of Infection and
Recovery is almost 85 percent, implying a high degree of infectiousness. Under other
conﬁgurations, the limiting size of the infected-then-recovered ‘compartment’ <img

factors that he explicitly compares to those that inﬂuence the spread of disease including (1) the
perceived reliability of the sender (which aﬀects infectiousness); (2) socioeconomic traits (which
aﬀect exposure and susceptibility); (3) the understandability of information by the receiver (degree of
immunity); and so on.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >  Arrow’s interpretation puts technological diﬀusion squarely in the realm of EE modeling, under

The factors that this literature identiﬁes as determinants of the dynamics of diﬀusion are directly

populations are “exposed” to the idea, and many of the other elements of epidemiological
models.

optimization problem to determine the intensity of their search eﬀort, which aﬀects the likelihood of
encountering an agent with a learnable “better technology.”  This is likely to be a common direction
in which economists may take epidemiological models: Incorporation of purposive behaviors by
agents. While some work in epidemiology allows agents to take actions to reduce the

and busts. A foundational assumption is that agents diﬀer in their beliefs (optimistic or
skeptical) about the fundamental value of housing (and the model collapses to a Rational
Expectations equilibrium under some simple alternative assumptions). Although it is a
random-mixing model, the paper has a mechanism with implications similar to those of the simplest
epidemiological model of ‘super-spreaders’ (in which some agents have many more social
connections than others): Their agents diﬀer in the degree of conﬁdence they have in their
opinions (whether optimistic or pessimistic) and those with greater conﬁdence are more
likely to convert those who have less conﬁdence. Because it is calibrated using survey
data on house price expectations, the model satisﬁes all our criteria for a full-ﬂedged
EE model. Their most interesting result is that whether a housing boom is followed by a
bust can depend on which opinion (optimistic or skeptical) turns out to be closer to the
true fundamental value: Busts happen when the skeptics turn out to be right about the
fundamentals, while booms caused by optimists who happen to be right are not followed by busts.

extrinsic belief shocks that neither aﬀect fundamentals (such as technology and preferences) nor the
beliefs about these fundamentals and shows that these shocks still drive equilibrium outcomes under
the critical assumption that imperfect communication prevents agents from achieving common
knowledge. The paper explores aggregate belief and output dynamics after an exogenous
sentiment shock hits a fraction of agents and gradually spreads via random mixing. The
paper computes population ﬂows between what an epidemiologist would describe as three
‘compartments’ (uninformed, informed, and fully informed about productivity). Such
dynamics induce “fad-like” or boom-bust dynamics of both aggregate beliefs and realized
outputs.

<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >The presence of social inﬂuences on agents’ expectations also has an aggregate saving/consumption
impact. For instance, without complete information about the state of the economy or future income
prospects, agents in the economy may form expectations via observing the consumption of others. In
such a context, <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">? </span>utilizes a sensible daily observation that usually the consumption of others tends to
be more salient than their savings (what the author called “visibility bias”) to explain the well-known
macroeconomic phenomenon of under-saving by households. When the agents fail to take into
account the asymmetry between signals from consumption and non-signals from saving of others in
the learning process, they hence form upward biased income expectation on average, which
leads to over-consumption in the equilibrium. It is worth noting that such a mechanism
works particularly through the expectation of agents instead of via preference-dependence,
a la the “catching up with the Joneses” eﬀect. The authors also argue that the secular
penetration of communication technology might have been a contributing force to the decline of
the saving rate of the United States since the 1980s, as it intensiﬁed the visibility bias of
consumption.

class="t1xb-x-x-120">? </span>also examine an economy
with agents who have diﬀerent macroeconomic forecasting rules. Aggregate dynamics
evolve as agents discard their own rules when they encounter other agents whose rules
have proven more eﬀective. Another way of describing this would be to say that more
eﬀective rules are more infectious. Indeed, the parallel to the biological process is deeper: As
diseases can do, the rules can mutate into more (or less) eﬀective forms. The paper also
discusses the potential role of professional forecasters and the extent to which their views
can spread to the population at large – in our terminology, because their views are more
‘viral.’

such correlations while remaining mute on the mechanism. (See <span

use news sources to construct an index of “economic policy uncertainty” and ﬁnd that it has
predictive power for macroeconomic outcomes beyond what can be extracted from the usual
indicators. The extent to which an epidemiological mechanism is necessary to make sense of this
ﬁnding is unclear; the authors’ interpretation seems to be mainly that they are measuring a
fundamental fact about the world (the policymaking process inherently and unavoidably generates
uncertainty).
<!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >  But the uncertainty the authors measure might be aﬀected by the structure of interactions in the
media ecosystem; the extensive literature on “fake news” (see <span

the incentives faced by suppliers of commentary would surely admit the possibility that
uncertainty might be introduced or ampliﬁed by epidemiological mechanisms , in which
case analysis of those mechanisms might yield some insight into whether changes in the
epidemiological landscape (say, the rise of Fox News) have consequences for economic
outcomes by changing the degree or dynamics of economic policy uncertainty. One way to
test for the epidemiological alternative might be consider alternative scenarios for the
policies that might be manifested as competing ‘narratives’ about how policymakers will
behave; the uncertainty would then be about which narrative would turn out to be
correct.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >Robert Shiller has repeatedly speculated that the driving force in aggregate ﬂuctuations, both for
asset markets and for macroeconomies, is the varying prevalence of alternative ‘narratives’ that
people believe capture the key ‘story’ of how the economy is working (his earliest statement of this
view seems to be <a

<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >  There are formidable obstacles to turning Shiller’s plausible idea into a quantitative modeling tool.
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
One is the diﬃculty of identifying the alternative narratives competing at any time, and reliably

“housing bubble,” “strong economy,” and “save more.” (See also <span

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >In the epidemiology literature and in ordinary usage the word “contagion” means essentially
‘epidemic of a transmissible disease.’ Large literatures in economics and ﬁnance describe themselves
as investigating economic or ﬁnancial ‘contagion.’ But for reasons we articulate here, most of this
work is quite diﬀerent from what we deﬁne as an EE modeling approach.

attempt to withdraw their savings from the bank, causing it to fail; in the other nobody wants to
withdraw their savings and the bank remains sound. But the paper’s model fails our ﬁrst criterion for
an EE model: There is no dynamic process by which ideas ‘spread’ so it has no testable
implications for measured expectational dynamics at either the micro or the macro level. Most of
the theoretical work about ‘contagion’ is of this kind – that is, about multiple equilibria
without any testable description of transmission or dynamics (much less measurement) of
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
expectations.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >  Nothing intrinsic to the questions this literature addresses prohibits construction of genuinely
epidemiological models – indeed, work by <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">? </span>makes an excellent start by collecting data on detailed
dynamics of bank withdrawals among members of a social network during a bank run episode.
The authors write: “we want to understand ... contagion in bank runs. In order to model
this, we draw on a long, time honored literature on contagion of infectious diseases in
the epidemiology literature.” (Note the explicit invocation the epidemiology literature,
presumably to head oﬀ possible confusion with whatever might be meant by ‘ﬁnancial
contagion.’)
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  They proceed to note that “the parallel [to infection] in bank runs is the probability of running as a
result of contact with a person who has already run.” The paper reports an estimated transmission
probability (corresponding to <img 
src="EpiExp-NBER66x.svg" alt="τ " class="math";align="absmiddle"> in Equation <a 
href="#x3-12005r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:beta --></a>) of 3.6 percent via social network connections and of
6 percent through neighborhood connections. Despite the straightforward structural implications of
these estimates, the authors stop without using them to parameterize and simulate an SI model of the
bank run they study. (These would be interesting steps to take for someone interested in advancing
the EE agenda.)
<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >  Another branch of the ‘ﬁnancial contagion’ literature that has aimed to understand the panic
occasioned by the 2008 collapse of Lehmann Brothers explores the idea that markets can be
vulnerable to the failure of entities that are ‘too interconnected to fail.’ This literature has
examined datasets on the interconnections between ﬁnancial institutions, using many of the
same tools (network theory, random graphs, etc) described above. But what has been
modeled as being transmitted along the network connections is usually ﬁnancial ﬂows (rather
than ideas or expectations), because ﬁnancial ﬂows are what the datasets measure. The
models therefore involve assumed mechanical consequences of disruptions to such ﬂows.
Despite the overarching “contagion” metaphor, the low-level elements of the transmission
process generally do not mainly aim to model the transmission of expectations at either the
micro or the aggregated level. (See <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">? </span>for a summary of this literature and <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">? </span>for a deep
dive).
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >  Some (most?) of this work could be reinterpreted to ﬁt into our deﬁnition of EE modeling, in
the same way that the work on technology diﬀusion clearly ﬁts our deﬁnitions and has a
straightforward epidemiological interpretation (articulated by <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>). But the literature is so vast and
complex, and the reinterpretation would have to be so thorough, that this is a task we hope
will be undertaken by others who want to bring the insights from that literature to a new
audience.

a natural extension of standard epidemiological models to incorporate the production side of the
content – “infectiousness” of certain ideas in subpopulations is an incentive for the production of
content that will become “viral” because of a high reproductive number in the targeted
subpopulation.

exclusive with being infected) who held competing ideas. Introducing skeptics generates an
additional steady state of the model where competing ideas coexist. This diﬀers from
two-compartment and three-compartment models, in which typically the system converges to a single

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >One attractive aspect of the EE modeling approach is that it opens the possibility of testing
competing models of an aggregate outcome using patterns in the cross-section and panel dynamics of
microeconomic expectations. Since there are often many competing models that are able to ﬁt aggregate
patterns roughly equally well (stock price dynamics, say) it should be possible to winnow down the
ﬁeld of plausible contenders using their diﬀerent predictions about microeconomic expectations
data.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >Common tools from epidemiological practice could usefully be imported into expectational surveys –
particularly tools that epidemiologists use to track the source of an infection (e.g., ‘contact tracing’).
After a person’s expectations have been elicited, at least a small amount of extra time should
sometimes be allocated to asking “why do you believe [x].” In many cases the respondent might have
a useful response: “A friend told me” or “I read it in the newspaper” or “I did some research on the
internet.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >  Several times we have mentioned evidence that information from certain sources, or of some
kinds, was more infectious; other evidence indicated that certain recipients are more susceptible to
infection. Direct survey questions asking respondents which sources of information they ﬁnd most
persuasive, and why, might prove very helpful in thinking about the most appropriate assumptions for
our models.

<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >There is also a rapidly expanding body of work that tries to answer economic questions by analyzing
‘big data’ on textual/conversational information using natural language processing (NLP). (See <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">? </span>for
an overview). As those tools get more sophisticated, they might become usable for creating reliable
methods for tracking the content of narratives in the manner required to turn Shiller’s ‘narrative
economics’ ideas into practical tools of current analysis.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  Separately, it is not beyond imagining that at some point, and to the extent that corporate interests
and privacy considerations permit, it will be possible to train AI algorithms to comb through social
network communications to identify economic narratives, and to measure the ways in which they
spread. Because such a source would have direct measures of social connections between agents, it
might be possible to construct a thoroughly satisfactory epidemiological model of Shiller’s narrative
theory of economic ﬂuctuations – and to see how eﬀective it is. But that date is still some distance in
the future.

  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.8  </span> <a 
 id="x3-320004.8"></a>Literature Summation</h4>
<!--l. 527--><p class="noindent" >We have barely scratched the surface of the scholarly literature with interesting evidence about the
ways in which social interactions shape population beliefs. Even within economics, where the topic
has received less attention than might be expected, there is so much material that we are conﬁdent
that we have missed some content that should have been included, for which we hereby preemptively
apologize to readers (and authors).
<!--l. 529--><p class="indent" >  Ideas that we would term ‘epidemiological’ have emerged independently in scholarly ﬁelds
that (ironically) seem largely unaware of each others’ existence. Diﬀerent terminology
and methodological tools have developed for ideas that are close cousins; this likely has
hindered the ability of participants in distant ﬁelds to recognize deep commonalities in their
work.
<!--l. 531--><p class="indent" >  For example, the work on “social learning” in macroeconomics studies the propagation of
competing forecasting rules via agent interactions in simulated populations. If it were couched as
being about the spread of beliefs in the eﬃcacy of the rules, this work would have satisﬁed our
criteria that it addressed a substantive economic question using a mechanism by which beliefs were
transmitted by social interaction. But authors in this literature often do not describe their models in
explicitly epidemiological terms, nor do they typically propose testing their models by querying
simulated agents about their expectations, and comparing simulated expectations data to actual
expectations data.
<!--l. 533--><p class="indent" >  Nor does this work take much notice of Shiller’s longstanding view that economic dynamics
reﬂect the competition of ‘narratives’ that ‘go viral.’ “Social learning” models’ forecasting
rules are arguably exactly how one might want to make a computational representation of
what Shiller calls a narrative, and the economic dynamics that result from the increasing
prevalence of the rules that succeed in ‘tournaments’ are a good candidate for a computational
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
representation of the consequences of what might be meant by the claim that ‘narratives’ can ‘go
viral.’
<!--l. 537--><p class="indent" >  Reciprocally, it does not seem that scholars interested in the “narrative approach” have embraced
“social learning in macroeconomics” literature – maybe because papers in that literature usually do
not describe the decisions the agents make as being a consequence of the “narratives” they have
adopted to understand the world.
<!--l. 539--><p class="indent" >  One of our ambitions is for this survey to infect scholars with the idea that it is useful to describe
their models in a common language drawn as much as possible from the familiar domains of
epidemiological modeling and network theory: Infectiousness, susceptibility, transmissibility,
exposure, immunity, mixing, homophily, reproduction rates, degree distributions, clustering,
mutation, and so on (in place of miscellaneous other words that in practice are synonymous with the
epidemiological term).

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5  </span> <a 
 id="x3-330005"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Many of the obstacles, real and perceived, to the construction of what we call full-ﬂedged
Epidemiological Expectations models have lessened over the last two decades.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >  A large body of evidence now ﬁnds that opinions on economic questions are sharply
heterogeneous, and that people’s choices are related to their (surveyed) opinions.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >  Data from social networks now provide the possibility of directly observing the key mechanisms
of the social transmission of ideas – as has already been done in a few cases of economic models (and
many more cases outside of economics).
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >  Other work based on measures of ‘clustering’ like geographical proximity or shared workplaces
has found robust evidence of social transmission of ideas, while another strand of research has
explored the ways in which each news outlet can be modeled as a source of heterogeneity in
beliefs if news stories have degrees of either exposure or infectiousness less than 100
percent.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >  The recent successes achieved by the HA-Macro literature from incorporating measurable
heterogeneity in non-expectational variables seem likely to tempt scholars to see what more can be
accomplished with structural models of expectational heterogeneity calibrated to match empirically
measured expectations. While there are other mechanisms for generating heterogeneity, given the
copious evidence of epidemiological transmission of beliefs and the rich toolkits for epidemiological
modeling, ‘EE’ modeling seems a natural choice.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  An EE approach is by no means applicable only to macroeconomic questions; expectations are at
the heart of all sorts of economic questions. Available tools allow economists to expand their
imagination far beyond the limits of ‘classical’ epidemiological models. A particularly attractive
direction that any literature written by economists is likely to take is to apply the discipline’s
sophisticated tools for analyzing purposive behavior, as is done for example in the paper by <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>
whose agents optimally expose themselves to the possibility of infection with new ideas
in the hopes of improving their productivity – something scholars have done since time
immemorial.
