<!--l. 205--><p class="noindent" >It is a commonplace, in academia and popular culture, that ideas spread like diseases: they can
be “infectious” or “go viral.” The proposition is hardly new; as <span

Indeed, in ﬁelds other than economics, debates are rarely about whether social interactions are
fundamental; the question is usually which particular models of social communication are most
suitable for understanding the prevalence of which kinds of ideas.
<!--l. 209--><p class="indent" >  “Expectations” are just a category of ideas. So upon being told that expectations play a critical role
in structural economic modeling, a scholar who was not an economist might suppose that
epidemiological approaches would be a standard part of the economist’s toolkit for modeling
expectations — unless there were good reason to suppose that economic ideas are immune to
social inﬂuence. But evidence for social transmission of economic ideas is plentiful – see
Section <a 
href="#x3-200004.4">4.4<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:microEvidence --></a>.
<!--l. 211--><p class="indent" >  Yet it would not be accurate to say that an ‘epidemiological expectations’ (‘EE’) approach is a
standard way of constructing formal models of economic phenomena – a conventional oﬀ-the-shelf
alternative, say, to a ‘rational expectations’ (‘RE’) approach, the ‘Rational Inattention’ (‘RI’)
approach advocated by <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>, the ‘diagnostic expectations’ model of <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>, or a number of bounded
rationality approaches (e.g., <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">? </span>or <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>).
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
<!--l. 213--><p class="indent" >  This is perhaps because nowhere has any focused attempt been
made to deﬁne what would constitute an EE treatment of an economic
question.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="EpiExp-NBER5.html#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x3-3002f2"></a>   
For the purposes of this survey, we will think of a full-ﬂedged EE treatment as incorporating the
following elements:
      <div class="quote">
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x3-3004x1"><span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">a  mechanism:  </span>An  explicit  and  rigorous  mathematical  description  of  a
     process by which ideas are transmitted between agents ...
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x3-3006x2"><span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">implying expectational dynamics: </span>... that generates observable expectation
     dynamics at the level of individuals or populations ...
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x3-3008x3"><span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">with  economic  consequences:   </span>...  and  those  expectations  have  knock-on
     implications for an observable outcome (often, prices, quantities, or market
     values) that is the primary subject of the economic analysis.</li></ol>
      </div>
<!--l. 229--><p class="indent" >  These criteria whittle down a vast number of invocations, or partial treatments, of the proposition
that ideas spread through social interaction, to the surprisingly small number of papers on which we
primarily focus here. (The last criterion allows us to neglect enormous literatures on public opinion,
politics, musical tastes, internet memes, and other topics).
<!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >  We have identiﬁed three ﬁelds in economics – technological diﬀusion (section  <a 
href="#x3-140004.1">4.1<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:techDiffusion --></a>), asset pricing
(section <a 
href="#x3-150004.2">4.2<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:assetprice --></a>), and macroeconomics (section <a 
href="#x3-160004.3">4.3<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:macroExp --></a>) – with sets of papers that satisfy all these criteria,
even if in some cases the work has not mainly been thought of as ‘epidemiological’ until
now.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="EpiExp-NBER6.html#fn3x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x3-3009f3"></a>    In
addition, we survey the proliferating evidence that social interactions drive expectations and
corresponding behaviors (section <a 
href="#x3-200004.4">4.4<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:microEvidence --></a>); draw connections between the EE approach and a
separate literature on ﬁnancial contagion (section <a 
href="#x3-260004.5">4.5<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:Contagion --></a>); and present selected examples from
the research outside of economics that might be particularly interesting for economists

<!--l. 237--><p class="indent" >  In their introduction to the
<span

class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>]</a> wrote that the most universal
lesson of micro economics is that “people are diﬀerent in ways that importantly aﬀect their economic
behavior.”
Since then, a great deal of the progress in macro economics has come from incorporating
microeconomic heterogeneity “in ways that importantly aﬀect” macroeconomic behavior. (See
“Macroeconomics and Heterogeneity” in the latest <span 
class="t1xi-x-x-120">Handbook of Macroeconomics</span>, <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>). In particular,
Heterogeneous Agent (‘HA-Macro’) models that match the distributions of income and wealth have
now provided rigorous microfoundations for Keynesian macroeconomics by capturing measured
heterogeneity in (and a large average value for) the marginal propensity to consume – see <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>’s Laﬀont
lecture.
<!--l. 251--><p class="indent" >  But few models in the HA-Macro literature have allowed for diﬀerences in agents’ expectations
about variables like stock returns (where everyone’s realized outcome will be identical) – though
disagreements on such subjects are rife and people make choices that correspond to their expressed
beliefs (<span

<!--l. 261--><p class="indent" >  Partly, the failure to incorporate expectational heterogeneity reﬂects the fact that until recently
there was not widespread awareness among macroeconomists that measurable expectation
diﬀerences have power to explain observable microeconomic behavior. Evidence of the recent change
in attitudes can be seen in the published discussions in the 2017 <span 
class="t1xi-x-x-120">NBER Macroeconomics Annual</span>
of <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>’s paper surveying the literature on the measurement of expectations (in which Manski himself
has been the leading ﬁgure, and until recently something of a lone voice crying in the

summarized herein, are among the many other indications of a sea-change in the profession’s
attitudes.
<!--l. 284--><p class="indent" >  The proliferation of new data on expectations, and new evidence that they explain diﬀerences in
behavior, seem likely to tempt economists to produce models to ﬁt the facts. Our guess is
that epidemiological models may be one of the primary methods of accomplishing this
goal.
  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2  </span> <a 
 id="x3-60002.2"></a>Epistemology and Epidemiology</h4>
<!--l. 284--><p class="noindent" >Below we brieﬂy summarize the extensive literature outside of economics measuring the spread of
ideas. One element is missing from almost all of this work: a rigorous description of a mechanism
that accounts for an endogenous <span 
class="t1xi-x-x-120">origin </span>of the ideas.
<!--l. 284--><p class="indent" >  Economists and philosophers seem to be unusual in wanting a rigorous epistemology: An
account of the origin of the ideas and why they are ‘justiﬁed.’ The Rational Expectations
approach resolves this problem by making some rather bold assumptions (there is only one
‘true’ model of the world; everyone fully understands and completely believes the same
true model; everyone observes an identical set of facts and uses deductive reasoning to
draw the same conclusions from them; everyone <span 
class="t1xi-x-x-120">knows </span>that everyone deduces ... ; and so
on).
<!--l. 284--><p class="indent" >  An appealing way to connect these approaches is for epidemiological models in economics to be
built to be ‘tunable’ in the degree to which they diﬀer from more familiar models (like
‘rational expectations’). This should not be hard: If the only ‘source’ of ideas is an agent who
believes in the rational expectations solution, and the infection rate is 100 percent, the
solution will be the rational expectations solution. It will then be possible to pin down,
step by step, the reasons for any deviation between the EE and the corresponding RE
model.
<!--l. 284--><p class="indent" >  In fact, most of the examples of EE models we articulate below are of this kind: There is some
parameter or set of parameters which can be set to zero (or some other speciﬁc value), causing the
model to collapse to a RE model.

<!--l. 289--><p class="noindent" >We will use the word ‘classical’ to refer to epidemiological models that descend from <span

formulated the problem as one of tracking the size of ‘compartments’ of the population in diﬀerent
disease states (‘Susceptible’ to infection, ‘Infected,’ or ‘Recovered’; S, I, and R for short) under a
‘random mixing’ assumption in which all members of the population were equally likely to
encounter each other in a time interval. These assumptions allowed formulation of the problem as a
set of nonlinear diﬀerential equations.
<!--l. 291--><p class="indent" >  A newer literature uses the tools of ‘network theory’ to study models in which the ‘nodes’ in a

model in which connections among agents were a ‘random graph’ (the network analog of
the ‘random mixing’ assumption), so the only parameter was ‘degree’: the number of
connections each agent had. Subsequent work relaxed the random graph assumption,
allowing meaningful deﬁnition of an agent’s ‘neighbors,’ and showed that a ‘clustering
coeﬃcient’ is a useful measurement of the extent to which a person’s neighbors know each
other.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

outcome depends sensitively not only on the structure of the network but also on the exact

factors that he explicitly compares to those that inﬂuence the spread of disease including (1) the
perceived reliability of the sender (which aﬀects infectiousness); (2) socioeconomic traits (which
aﬀect exposure and susceptibility); (3) the understandability of information by the receiver (degree of

The factors that this literature identiﬁes as determinants of the dynamics of diﬀusion are directly

populations are “exposed” to the idea, and many of the other elements of epidemiological
models.

optimization problem to determine the intensity of their search eﬀort, which aﬀects the likelihood of
encountering an agent with a learnable “better technology.”  This is likely to be a common direction
in which economists may take epidemiological models: Incorporation of purposive behaviors by
agents. While some work in epidemiology allows agents to take actions to reduce the

<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >  Academic models of ﬁnancial markets traditionally assume investors choose stocks based on
well-informed rational beliefs about future returns. But popular treatments have emphasized social
communication, and ideas with a distinctly epidemiological ﬂavor, since the ﬁrst published
description of the ﬁrst publicly traded securities (<span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>’s account of the trading of shares of the East India
company on the Amsterdam stock exchange). <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>’s vivid prose has made his (thoroughly
epidemiological) descriptions of the Dutch Tulip mania and other ﬁnancial episodes of “The
Madness of Crowds” a classic of English literature. This popular emphasis on the importance of
social interactions has continued to the present: Michael <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>’s bestseller about the ﬁnancial crisis of
2008-09 goes so far as to suggest that one of the reasons a particular analyst was able to
perceive the housing bubble early was his temperamental indiﬀerence to other people’s
opinions.
<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >  The academic tide seems now to be turning in this popular direction. <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>’s Presidential Address to
the American Finance Association urged the profession take up the study of the social transmission

small.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >  An early example of such a comprehensive approach is <span

elements of an SIR model. Now we interpret its content as an economic model. <span

individual active investors to understand the sources of information that generated their initial
interest in the stock they had most recently purchased (which they designate as ‘randomly

class="t1xtt-x-x-120">RPI</span>’). A separate
survey of institutional investors used a diﬀerent methodology to designate <span 
class="t1xtt-x-x-120">RAND </span>and <span 
class="t1xtt-x-x-120">RPI</span>
stocks.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >  Their survey-based estimates of the epidemiological model for both individual (‘<span

institutional (‘<span

within and between the groups. The estimates also suggest that infectiousness diﬀers
between a randomly selected stock <span

converges to a high value.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >  The results can now also be interpreted in temporal terms. The authors note that a fully rational
model with no private information would imply that trading volume should immediately follow news
events, while the epidemiological model is consistent with long and variable lags. It takes around half
a year for the interest of institutional investors in the randomly selected stocks to reach its peak and a
little more than a year for a rapidly rising stock. For individual investors, the population
interested in <span 
class="t1xtt-x-x-120">RAND </span>reaches its peak after 40 weeks, while interest in <span

peak.
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >  The paper also argues that in a special case where the infection rate is close to the removal rate,
and the size of the pool of interested investors is driven by serially uncorrelated shocks, stock prices
could follow a random walk, because the change in the level of ‘interest’ would be nearly
unforecastable.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >  Remarkably little of the large literature citing <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">? </span>has involved meaningful epidemiological
modeling; it has either been nonstructurally empirical, or has used a modeling framework

followup is the nonexistence of direct data on either of the two key components of the
model: beliefs (about, say, stock prices); and social connections. <span

assumptions to quantify their model. Few subsequent scholars have been willing to go so far in

results imply that news of this kind does not lead to an epidemic of stock trading. This
is in contrast with <span

diﬀerence highlights the extent to which epidemiological models must be interpreted with
care; even if similar phenomena (stock trading) are being studied, and even if there is
evidence of social communication, the estimated nature and size of the epidemiological
consequences can vary greatly depending on the exact experiment.  The authors also ﬁnd stronger
transmission between investors of the same characteristics (age, income category, and
gender), conﬁrming the usual presumption of homophily (people trust others with similar
backgrounds); and between senders and receivers with high past performance, the natural

class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span></a>, which shows how incorporating social interactions can generate booms and busts.
A foundational assumption is that agents diﬀer in their beliefs (optimistic or skeptical) about
the fundamental value of housing (and the model collapses to a Rational Expectations
equilibrium under some simple alternative assumptions). Although it is a random-mixing model,
the paper has a mechanism similar in its implications to the simplest epidemiological
model of ‘super-spreaders’ in which some agents have many more social connections than
others: Agents diﬀer in the degree of conﬁdence they have in their opinions (whether
optimistic or pessimistic) and those with greater conﬁdence are more likely to convert
those who have less conﬁdence. The model is calibrated using survey data on house price
expectations.Their most interesting result is that whether a housing boom is followed by a
bust can depend on which opinion (optimistic or skeptical) turns out to be closer to the
true fundamental value: Busts happen when the skeptics turn out to be right about the
fundamentals, while booms caused by optimists who happen to be right are not followed by
busts.

terminology is sometimes explicitly invoked in the literature. Economists interested in constructing
formal EE models would do well to delve into that literature for ideas that could be reinterpreted (or
relabeled) to purpose. We have chosen not to survey this literature partly because there are a number
of excellent surveys already available, and partly because the literature has not mainly interpreted
itself as modeling the dynamics of expectations (and has mostly not tested its models with data on

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >In the epidemiology literature and in ordinary usage the word “contagion” means essentially
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
‘epidemic of a transmissible disease.’ Large literatures in economics and ﬁnance describe themselves
as investigating economic or ﬁnancial ‘contagion.’ But for reasons we articulate here, most of this
work is quite diﬀerent from what we deﬁne as an EE modeling approach.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >  <a 
href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1837095" ><span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span></a>’s canonical model of ‘bank runs’ has two RE (self-fulﬁlling) equilibria. In one, all depositors
attempt to withdraw their savings from the bank, causing it to fail; in the other nobody wants to
withdraw their savings and the bank remains sound. But the paper’s model fails our ﬁrst criterion for
an EE model: There is no dynamic process by which ideas ‘spread’ so it has no testable
implications for measured expectational dynamics at either the micro or the macro level. Most of
the theoretical work about ‘contagion’ is of this kind – that is, about multiple equilibria
without any testable description of transmission or dynamics (much less measurement) of
expectations.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >  Nothing intrinsic to the questions this literature addresses prohibits construction of genuinely
epidemiological models – indeed, work by <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">? </span>makes an excellent start by collecting data on detailed
dynamics of bank withdrawals among members of a social network during a bank run episode.
The authors write: “we want to understand ... contagion in bank runs. In order to model
this, we draw on a long, time honored literature on contagion of infectious diseases in
the epidemiology literature.” (Note the explicit invocation the epidemiology literature,
presumably to head oﬀ possible confusion with whatever might be meant by ‘ﬁnancial
contagion.’)
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  They proceed to note that “the parallel [to infection] in bank runs is the probability of running as a
result of contact with a person who has already run.” The paper reports an estimated transmission
probability (corresponding to <img 
src="EpiExp-NBER67x.svg" alt="τ " class="math";align="absmiddle"> in Equation <a 
href="#x3-12004r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:beta --></a>) of 3.6 percent via social network connections and of
6 percent through neighborhood connections. Despite the straightforward structural implications of
these estimates, the authors stop without using them to parameterize and simulate an SI model of the
bank run they study. (These would be interesting steps to take for someone interested in advancing
the EE agenda.)
<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >  Another branch of the ‘ﬁnancial contagion’ literature that has aimed to understand the panic
occasioned by the 2008 collapse of Lehmann Brothers explores the idea that markets can be
vulnerable to the failure of entities that are ‘too interconnected to fail.’ This literature has
examined datasets on the interconnections between ﬁnancial institutions, using many of the
same tools (network theory, random graphs, etc) described above. But what has been
modeled as being transmitted along the network connections is usually ﬁnancial ﬂows (rather
than ideas or expectations), because ﬁnancial ﬂows are what the datasets measure. The
models therefore involve assumed mechanical consequences of disruptions to such ﬂows.
Despite the overarching “contagion” metaphor, the low-level elements of the transmission
process generally do not mainly aim to model the transmission of expectations at either the
micro or the aggregated level. (See <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">? </span>for a summary of this literature and <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">? </span>for a deep
dive).
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >  Some (most?) of this work could be reinterpreted to ﬁt into our deﬁnition of EE modeling, in
the same way that the work on technology diﬀusion clearly ﬁts our deﬁnitions and has a
straightforward epidemiological interpretation (articulated by <span 
class="t1xb-x-x-120">?</span>). But the literature is so vast and
complex, and the reinterpretation would have to be so thorough, that this is a task we hope
will be undertaken by others who want to bring the insights from that literature to a new

a natural extension of standard epidemiological models to incorporate the production side of the

where E represents the exposed state, and a SEIZ model where Z represents skeptics (mutually

additional steady state of the model where competing ideas coexist. This diﬀers from

competing models of an aggregate outcome using patterns in the cross-section and panel dynamics of
microeconomic expectations. Since there are often many competing models that are able to ﬁt aggregate
patterns roughly equally well (stock price dynamics, say) it should be possible to winnow down the
ﬁeld of plausible contenders using their diﬀerent predictions about microeconomic expectations

<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >Common tools from epidemiological practice could usefully be imported into expectational surveys –
particularly tools that epidemiologists use to track the source of an infection (e.g., ‘contact tracing’).
After a person’s expectations have been elicited, at least a small amount of extra time should
sometimes be allocated to asking “why do you believe [x].” In many cases the respondent might have
a useful response: “A friend told me” or “I read it in the newspaper” or “I did some research on the
internet.”<span class="footnote-mark"><a

our models.

methods for tracking the content of narratives in the manner required to turn Shiller’s ‘narrative

<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  Separately, it is not beyond imagining that at some point, and to the extent that corporate interests
and privacy considerations permit, it will be possible to train AI algorithms to comb through social
network communications to identify economic narratives, and to measure the ways in which they
spread. Because such a source would have direct measures of social connections between agents, it
might be possible to construct a thoroughly satisfactory epidemiological model of Shiller’s narrative
theory of economic ﬂuctuations – and to see how eﬀective it is. But that date is still some distance in
the future.

  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.8  </span> <a

<!--l. 529--><p class="noindent" >We have barely scratched the surface of the scholarly literature with interesting evidence about the
ways in which social interactions shape population beliefs. Even within economics, where the topic
has received less attention than might be expected, there is so much material that we are conﬁdent
that we have missed some content that should have been included, for which we hereby preemptively
apologize to readers (and authors).
<!--l. 531--><p class="indent" >  Common themes have emerged independently from scholarly communities who (ironically) seem
largely unaware of each others’ existence. Diﬀerent terminology has developed for ideas that are
close cousins; this likely has hindered the ability of participants in distant ﬁelds to recognize deep
commonalities in their work.
<!--l. 533--><p class="indent" >  For example, the work on “social learning” in macroeconomics studies the propagation of
competing forecasting rules in simulated population. If it were couched as being about the spread of
beliefs in the eﬃcacy of the rules, this work would have satisﬁed our criteria that it addressed a
substantive economic question using a mechanism by which beliefs were transmitted by social
interaction. But authors in this literature often do not describe their models in explicitly
epidemiological terms, nor do they typically propose testing their models by querying simulated
agents about their expectations, and comparing simulated expectations data to actual expectations
data.
<!--l. 535--><p class="indent" >  Nor does this work take much notice of Shiller’s longstanding view that economic dynamics
reﬂect the competition of ‘narratives’ that ‘go viral.’ “Social learning” models’ forecasting
rules are arguably exactly how one might want to make a computational representation of
what Shiller calls a narrative, and the economic dynamics that result from the increasing
prevalence of the rules that succeed in ‘tournaments’ are a good candidate for a computational
representation of the consequences of what might be meant by the claim that ‘narratives’ can ‘go
viral.’
<!--l. 539--><p class="indent" >  Reciprocally, it does not seem that scholars interested in the “narrative approach” have embraced
“social learning in macroeconomics” literature – maybe because papers in that literature usually do
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
not describe the decisions the agents make as being a consequence of the “narratives” they have

<!--l. 541--><p class="indent" >  One of our ambitions is for this survey to infect scholars with the idea that it is useful to describe
their models in a common language drawn as much as possible from the familiar domains of
epidemiological modeling and network theory: Infectiousness, susceptibility, transmissibility,
exposure, immunity, mixing, homophily, reproduction rates, degree distributions, clustering, and so
on (in addition to whatever domain-speciﬁc terminology may be natural to their particular
topic).

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Many of the obstacles, real and perceived, to the construction of what we call full-ﬂedged
Epidemiological Expectations models have lessened over the last two decades.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >  A large body of evidence now ﬁnds that opinions on economic questions are sharply
heterogeneous, and that people’s choices are related to their (surveyed) opinions.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >  Data from social networks now provide the possibility of directly observing the key mechanisms
of the social transmission of ideas – as has already been done in a few cases of economic models (and
many more cases outside of economics).
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >  Other work based on measures of ‘clustering’ like geographical proximity or shared workplaces
has found robust evidence of social transmission of ideas, while another strand of research has
explored the ways in which each news outlet can be modeled as a source of heterogeneity in
beliefs if news stories have degrees of either exposure or infectiousness less than 100
percent.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >  The recent successes achieved by the HA-Macro literature from incorporating measurable
heterogeneity in non-expectational variables seem likely to tempt scholars to see what more can be
accomplished with structural models of expectational heterogeneity calibrated to match empirically
measured expectations. While there are other mechanisms for generating heterogeneity, given the
copious evidence of epidemiological transmission of beliefs and the rich toolkits for epidemiological
modeling, ‘EE’ modeling seems a natural choice.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  An EE approach is by no means applicable only to macroeconomic questions; expectations are at
the heart of all sorts of economic questions. Available tools allow economists to expand their
imagination far beyond the limits of ‘classical’ epidemiological models. A particularly attractive
direction that any literature written by economists is likely to take is to apply the discipline’s
sophisticated tools for analyzing purposive behavior, as is done for example in the paper by <span

whose agents optimally expose themselves to the possibility of infection with new ideas
in the hopes of improving their productivity – something scholars have done since time
immemorial.
