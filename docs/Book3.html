                Indeed, in ↓elds other than economics, debates are rarely about whether social interactions
                are fundamental; the question is which particular models for capturing social
                interactions are most suitable for understanding the prevalence of which kinds of
                ideas.

                economic decisions, the case for using the epidemiological modeling toolkit would be
                weaker. We therefore conclude this section on ‘background and motivation’ by presenting
                some evidence of a recent clear failure of ‘identical beliefs’ with consequences for
                measured choices in an area core to both micro and macro modeling: ↓nancial

                booms and busts. A foundational assumption is that agents di↑er in their beliefs
                (optimistic or skeptical) about the fundamental value of housing. Although it is a
                random-mixing model, the paper has a mechanism similar in its implications to the
                simplest epidemiological model of ‘super-spreaders’ that obtains when some agents have
                many more social connections than others: Agents di↑er in the degree of con↓dence they
                have in their opinions (whether optimistic or pessimistic) and those with greater con↓dence
                are more likely to convert those who have less con↓dence. Their most interesting
                result is that whether a housing boom is followed by a bust can depend on which
                opinion (optimistic or skeptical) turns out to be closer to the true fundamental
                value: Busts happen when the skeptics turn out to be right about the fundamentals,
                while booms caused by optimists who happen to be right are not followed by
                busts.

                reinterpret much of this work as exploring epidemiological models of expectations of asset

                nobody wants to withdraw their savings and the bank remains sound. But the paper’s
                model fails our ↓rst criterion for an EE model: There is no dynamic process by which ideas
                ‘spread’ so it has no testable implications for measured expectational dynamics at either
                the micro or the macro level.
                <!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >      Much of the theoretical work about ‘contagion’ is of this kind { that is, about multiple
                equilibria without any testable description of transmission or dynamics (much less
                measurement of expectations).

                dynamics of bank withdrawals among members of a social network during a
                bank run episode. The authors write: \we want to understand ... contagion in
                bank runs. In order to model this, we draw on a long, time honored literature
                on contagion of infectious diseases in the epidemiology literature.” (Note the
                explicit invocation of the meaning of ‘contagion’ from the epidemiology literature,
                presumably to head o↑ possible confusion with whatever might be meant by ‘↓nancial
                contagion.’)
                <!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >      They proceed to note that \the parallel [to infection] in bank runs is the probability of
                running as a result of contact with a person who has already run.” The paper reports
                an estimated transmission probability (corresponding to <img

href="#x3-9005r1">1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:beta --></a>) of
                3.6 percent via social network connections (approximated by account referrals)
                and of 6 percent through neighborhood connections. Despite the straightforward
                structural implications of these estimates, the authors stop without using them
                to parameterize and simulate an SI model of the bank run they study. (These
                would be interesting steps to take for someone interested in advancing the EE
                agenda.)
                <!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >      One branch of the ‘↓nancial contagion’ literature that developed after the panic
                following the collapse of Lehmann Brothers in 2008 explores the idea that markets can be
                vulnerable to the sudden disappearance of entities that are ‘too interconnected
                to fail.’ This led to a literature that examined datasets on the interconnections
                between ↓nancial institutions, using many of the same tools (network theory,
                random graphs, etc) that have elsewhere been used to model the transmission of
                ideas across social networks. But what has been modeled as being transmitted
                along the network connections is usually ↓nancial &#x0027;ows (rather than ideas or
                expectations), because ↓nancial &#x0027;ows are what the datasets measure. The modeled
                mechanisms of contagion therefore involve assumed mechanical consequences of
                disruptions to such &#x0027;ows. Despite the overarching \contagion” metaphor, the
                low-level elements of the transmission process generally do not have interpretations
                corresponding to epidemiological primitives like ‘infectiousness,’ and the literature does
                not mainly aim to model the transmission of expectations at either the micro or
                the aggregated level. (See <span

                unaware of each others’ existence. Di↑erent terminology has developed for ideas that are
                close cousins; this likely has hindered the ability of participants in distant ↓elds to
                recognize commonalities in their work.
                <!--l. 544--><p class="indent" >      For example, the work on \social learning” in macroeconomics involves the
                propagation of competing forecasting rules in a population. Interpreting rules as the
                consequence of beliefs, this work satis↓ed our criteria that it addressed a substantive
                economic question using a mechanism by which beliefs were transmitted by explicit social
                interaction: The rules that work better, basically, embody ideas that are more
                infectious. But authors in this literature often do not describe their models in explicitly
                epidemiological terms, nor do they typically propose testing their models by querying
                simulated agents about their simulated expectations, and comparing simulated expectations
                data to actual expectations data.

                forecasting rules are arguably exactly how one might want to make a computational
                representation of what Shiller calls a narrative, and the economic dynamics that result from
                the increasing prevalence of the rules that succeed in ‘tournaments’ are a good candidate

                shared workplaces or common places of origin, has found evidence of social
                transmission of ideas, while another strand of research has explored the ways
                in which news outlets can be modeled as a source of heterogeneity in beliefs
                if news stories have degrees of either exposure or infectiousness less than 100
                percent.

                realistic heterogeneity in non-expectational variables seem likely to tempt scholars to see
                what more can be accomplished with structural models of expectational heterogeneity
                calibrated to match empirically measured expectations.
