                Indeed, in ↓elds other than economics, debates are rarely about whether social
                interactions are fundamental; the question is usually which particular models of social
                communication are most suitable for understanding the prevalence of which kinds of
                ideas.

                <!--l. 451--><p class="indent" >      Basic epidemiological models usually study the dynamics of a single disease in a
                population, with a natural terminal stage like recovery or death. Economists will often be
                interested in keeping track of how expectations change about an aggregate variable like
                stock prices, which does not have a terminal point and in which many competing opinions
                may infect di↑erent people at the same time.
                <!--l. 453--><p class="indent" >      An advantage of network-theory tools is that they can easily accommodate ways in
                which an economic application may call for such modi↓cations. It is trivial to represent as
                many competing ‘diseases’ (e.g., theories of stock prices) as desired, and there is no need
                to specify a ‘recovery’ state.

                painful to capture dynamics of a disease in which people become ‘more infected’

                easy to capture the proposition that a person may need to be exposed to an

                This literature has examined datasets on the interconnections between ↓nancial
                institutions, using many of the same tools (network theory, random graphs, etc)
                described above. But what has been modeled as being transmitted along the network
                connections is usually ↓nancial &#x0027;ows (rather than ideas or expectations), because
                ↓nancial &#x0027;ows are what the datasets measure. The models therefore involve assumed
                mechanical consequences of disruptions to such &#x0027;ows. Despite the overarching
