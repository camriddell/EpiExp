                Indeed, in ↓elds other than economics, debates are rarely about whether social interactions
                are fundamental; the question is which particular models for capturing social
                interactions are most suitable for understanding the prevalence of which kinds of
                ideas.

                economic decisions, the case for using the epidemiological modeling toolkit would be
                weaker. We therefore conclude this section on ‘background and motivation’ by presenting
                some evidence of a recent clear failure of ‘identical beliefs’ with consequences for
                measured choices in an area core to both micro and macro modeling: ↓nancial

                booms and busts. A foundational assumption is that agents di↑er in their beliefs
                (optimistic or skeptical) about the fundamental value of housing. Although it is a
                random-mixing model, the paper has a mechanism similar in its implications to the
                simplest epidemiological model of ‘super-spreaders’ that obtains when some agents have
                many more social connections than others: Agents di↑er in the degree of con↓dence they
                have in their opinions (whether optimistic or pessimistic) and those with greater con↓dence
                are more likely to convert those who have less con↓dence. Their most interesting
                result is that whether a housing boom is followed by a bust can depend on which
                opinion (optimistic or skeptical) turns out to be closer to the true fundamental
                value: Busts happen when the skeptics turn out to be right about the fundamentals,
                while booms caused by optimists who happen to be right are not followed by
                busts.

                reinterpret much of this work as exploring epidemiological models of expectations of asset

                <!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >In the epidemiology literature and in ordinary usage the word \contagion” means
                essentially ‘epidemic of a transmissible disease.’ Large literatures in economics and
                ↓nance describe themselves as investigating economic or ↓nancial ‘contagion.’ But for
                reasons we articulate here, most of this work is quite di↑erent from what we de↓ne as an
                EE modeling approach.

                depositors attempt to withdraw their savings from the bank, causing it to fail; in the other
                nobody wants to withdraw their savings and the bank remains sound. But the paper’s
                model fails our ↓rst criterion for an EE model: There is no dynamic process by which ideas
                ‘spread’ so it has no testable implications for measured expectational dynamics at either
                the micro or the macro level.
                <!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >      Much of the theoretical work about ‘contagion’ is of this kind { that is, about multiple

                collecting data on detailed dynamics of bank withdrawals among members of a social
                network during a bank run episode. The authors write: \we want to understand ...
                contagion in bank runs. In order to model this, we draw on a long, time honored literature
                on contagion of infectious diseases in the epidemiology literature.” (Note the
                explicit invocation of the meaning of ‘contagion’ from the epidemiology literature,
                presumably to head o↑ possible confusion with whatever might be meant by ‘↓nancial
                contagion.’)

                running as a result of contact with a person who has already run.” The paper reports
                an estimated transmission probability (corresponding to <img

                3.6 percent via social network connections (approximated by account referrals)
                and of 6 percent through neighborhood connections. Despite the straightforward
                structural implications of these estimates, the authors stop without using them
                to parameterize and simulate an SI model of the bank run they study. (These
                would be interesting steps to take for someone interested in advancing the EE

                same tools (network theory, random graphs, etc) that have elsewhere been used to model
                the transmission of ideas across social networks. But what has been modeled as being
                transmitted along the network connections is usually ↓nancial &#x0027;ows (rather than ideas or
                expectations), because ↓nancial &#x0027;ows are what the datasets measure. The modeled
                mechanisms of contagion therefore involve assumed mechanical consequences of
                disruptions to such &#x0027;ows. Despite the overarching \contagion” metaphor, the
                low-level elements of the transmission process generally do not have interpretations
                corresponding to epidemiological primitives like ‘infectiousness,’ and the literature does
                not mainly aim to model the transmission of expectations at either the micro or
                the aggregated level. (See <span

                consequence of beliefs, this work satis↓ed our criteria that it addressed a substantive
                economic question using a mechanism by which beliefs were transmitted by explicit social
                interaction: The rules that work better, basically, embody ideas that are more
                infectious. But authors in this literature often do not describe their models in explicitly
                epidemiological terms, nor do they typically propose testing their models by querying
                simulated agents about their simulated expectations, and comparing simulated expectations
                data to actual expectations data.

                mechanisms of the social transmission of ideas { as has already been done in a few
                cases of economic models (and many cases outside of economics). Other work,
                based not on social network data but on measures like geographical proximity or
                shared workplaces or common places of origin, has found evidence of social
                transmission of ideas, while another strand of research has explored the ways
                in which news outlets can be modeled as a source of heterogeneity in beliefs
                if news stories have degrees of either exposure or infectiousness less than 100
                percent.

                realistic heterogeneity in non-expectational variables seem likely to tempt scholars to see
                what more can be accomplished with structural models of expectational heterogeneity
                calibrated to match empirically measured expectations. While there are other
                mechanisms for generating such heterogeneity, epidemiological modeling is a promising
                candidate.

                But available tools allow economists to expand their imagination far beyond the limited
                ‘classical’ epidemiological models. A particularly attractive direction that any literature
                written by economists is likely to take is to apply the discipline’s sophisticated tools for
                analyzing purposive behavior, as is done for example in the paper by <span

                optimally expose themselves to the possibility of infection with new ideas in the
